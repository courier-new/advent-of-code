# Advent of Code

Here you'll find my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles,
written in TypeScript! 💙

As per the site guidelines, none of my personal puzzle inputs are included. If you want to
run the code yourself, you'll need to create an account and download your own inputs.
Stick any input file alongside its corresponding puzzle solution code and name it
`{day}.txt` and you're good to go!

This repository is set up to use [bun](https://bun.sh/), particularly due to the advantage
that it can run TypeScript code directly without any additional dependencies or
compilation steps.

To run the code for a particular day, you can use the following command from the project root:

```sh
bun {year}/{day}.ts
```

Happy coding! 🎉

## Progress

Though I had participated in Advent of Code a couple years in the past, I never did more
than a couple days' puzzles and I never saved any of my code. 😓 In 2023, I suddenly had a
lot more time on my hands and decided it was the perfect opportunity to pursue Advent of
Code again and seriously try to complete the full set of puzzles. Though I'm still
completing the last couple, I'm so proud of myself for sticking with it, and I can't wait
to add on to this repository in the years to come!
