# Advent of Code

Here you'll find my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
puzzles. As per the site guidelines, none of my personal puzzle inputs are
included.

## Progress

Though I had participated in Advent of Code a couple years in the past, I never did more
than a couple days' puzzles and I never saved any of my code. üòì In 2023, I suddenly had a
lot more time on my hands and decided it was the perfect opportunity to pursue Advent of
Code again and seriously try to complete the full set of puzzles. I didn't finish by
December 25th, but I'm so proud of myself for sticking with it through completion, and I
can't wait to add on to this repository in the years to come!

## Running the Code

For different years, I have used different tools!

### 2023: TypeScript

My most fluent and first choice language! üíô 2023 is set up to use
[bun](https://bun.sh/), particularly due to the advantage that it can run
TypeScript code directly without any additional dependencies or compilation
steps.

To run the code for a particular day, you can use the following command from the
2023 directory root:

```sh
bun {day}.ts
```

### 2024: Python

I decided to use Python in 2024 as a bit of a refresher, since I found myself
using it in a professional context again. üêç 2024 is set up to use
[poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), which is a fantastic tool for managing
Python dependencies and virtual environments.

To run the code for a particular day, you can use the following command from the
2024 directory root:

```sh
poetry run python {day}/main.py
```
